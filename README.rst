 **Due to 'Hollywood' legislation, the use of this software is illegal in most countrys. (but not in my country, hehe)**

 **The purpose of this git repo is to make FFdecsa (via FFdecsawrapper's loopback interface) available for use with MythTV and such.**

 **You can use it with kernel version 3.x and up, including more recent kernels (latest ok test: 3.14.1)**

 **dvbdev.h is included for all 3.x kernels, so you must not set --dvb_dir=/path/to/your/kernel/sources anymore. This setting is now reserved for use in the special case that you have to compile and install newest dvb drivers from v4l (or TBS and other v4l-based out of kernel drivers). Mind you, if you do, you should apply proper dvb-mutex patch to your sources prior to compiling. If you are not sure on how to do this:**

 - `Basic instructions for v4l are here. <http://www.lursen.org/wiki/V4l_and_ffdecsawrapper>`_

 **If you are running Debian with a clean unmodified Debian kernel, you don't need to recompile your kernel anymore, the running kernel will be properly patched during configuration of FFdecsawrapper. That is, if your sources.list is ok and the source for your Debian kernel is available from the repo's. Any missing build-deps for FFdecsawrapper and/or patching the dvb-core.ko kernel module will also be 'automagically' installed.**

 **USAGE:**
